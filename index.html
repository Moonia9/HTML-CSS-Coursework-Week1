          <h1>About the artist</h1>

          <p>Henri Cartier-Bresson (French: [kaʁtje bʁɛsɔ̃]; 22 August 1908 – 3 August 2004) was a French <em>humanist</em> photographer considered a master of candid photography, and an early user of 35 mm film. He pioneered the genre of street photography, and viewed photography as <b>capturing a decisive moment</b>.

            Cartier-Bresson was one of the founding members of <em>Magnum Photos </em>in 1947. In the 1970s he took up drawing—he had studied painting in the 1920s.</p>
            
            <p>Henri Cartier-Bresson was born in Chanteloup-en-Brie, Seine-et-Marne, France, the oldest of five children. His father was a wealthy textile manufacturer, whose Cartier-Bresson thread was a staple of French sewing kits. His mother's family were cotton merchants and landowners from Normandy, where Henri spent part of his childhood. His mother was descended from Charlotte Corday.[3] The Cartier-Bresson family lived in a bourgeois neighborhood in Paris, Rue de Lisbonne, near Place de l'Europe and Parc Monceau. His parents supported him financially so Henri could pursue photography more freely than his contemporaries. </p>

            <p> In his later years ,returning to France, Cartier-Bresson recuperated in Marseille in late 1931 and deepened his relationship with the Surrealists. He became inspired by a 1930 photograph by Hungarian photojournalist Martin Munkacsi showing three naked young African boys, caught in near-silhouette, running into the surf of Lake Tanganyika. Titled Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika, this captured the freedom, grace and spontaneity of their movement and their joy at being alive. That photograph inspired him to stop painting and to take up photography seriously. He explained, "I suddenly understood that a photograph could fix eternity in an instant."</p>

          He once said : <hr>
          <li><blockquote><em>To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event.</em></li>
          <hr>
          <li><em>Photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth which can make them come back again.</em></li>
          <hr>
          <li><em>In photography, the smallest thing can be a great subject. The little, human detail can become a Leitmotiv.</em>></li>

          <h3>The insightfulness of Bresson's work</h3>
          <p>Widely considered “a photographer around the world”, Cartier-Bresson covered almost every continent with his inconspicuous Leica and visitors can experience the evolution of his work by walking through the different sections of the exhibition.</p>
          <p>In order to keep his images natural, Cartier-Bresson opted for a camera that was light and easy to carry, making it possible to capture images that are totally spontaneous and meticulously composed.</p>
          <p>Cartier-Bresson was able to photograph while being virtually unseen and was for this reason regarded as a pioneer of photojournalism. He also refused to alter any of his images and artfully framed his photographs himself, combining art and visual documentation.</p>
          <p>The exhibition contributes to the effort being made to promote photographic expression in Colombia, and is also a chance for many emerging photographers and artists to bear witness to a comprehensive body of work of a canonical figure of the 20th century who elevated humanity’s decisive moments to an art form.</p>
